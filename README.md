# # HNEOSI (Hamid Naeemabadi Enhanced Open Systems Interconnection) Model v1.0 2025-01-08

## Abstract

This document specifies an extended version of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model, incorporating additional layers to address modern networking and organizational requirements. The new model introduces layers from the fundamental electrical signals to global organizational structures.

## 1. Introduction

The OSI model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement network protocols in seven layers. This document extends the traditional OSI model to include layers that represent higher-level abstractions, from individual users to global entities.

## 2. Layer Descriptions

### 0. Electricity

**Function:** This layer represents the fundamental electrical signals that underpin all network communications. It includes the generation, transmission, and reception of electrical signals.

**Details and Examples:**

- **Generation:** Electrical signals are generated by network devices such as routers, switches, and computers.
- **Transmission:** Signals are transmitted over various media, including copper wires, fiber optics, and wireless channels.
- **Reception:** Devices receive these signals and convert them into data that can be processed by higher layers.

### 1. Physical

**Function:** This layer defines the hardware elements involved in the network, including cables, switches, and other physical devices. It is responsible for the transmission and reception of raw bit streams over a physical medium.

**Details and Examples:**

- **Cables:** Ethernet cables (Cat5, Cat6), fiber optic cables.
- **Devices:** Network interface cards (NICs), hubs, repeaters.
- **Standards:** IEEE 802.3 (Ethernet), IEEE 802.11 (Wi-Fi).

### 2. Data Link

**Function:** The Data Link layer provides node-to-node data transfer and handles error correction from the Physical layer. It ensures reliable data transfer across the physical network.

**Details and Examples:**

- **Protocols:** Ethernet, PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol).
- **Error Detection:** CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) for error detection.
- **Flow Control:** Techniques like sliding window protocol to manage data flow.

### 3. Network

**Function:** The Network layer is responsible for path determination and logical addressing. It manages the routing of data packets from the source to the destination across multiple networks.

**Details and Examples:**

- **Protocols:** IP (Internet Protocol), ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol).
- **Routing:** Algorithms like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol).
- **Addressing:** IPv4 and IPv6 addressing schemes.

### 4. Transport

**Function:** This layer ensures end-to-end communication and data integrity. It provides reliable data transfer services to the upper layers, including error recovery and flow control.

**Details and Examples:**

- **Protocols:** TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
- **Error Recovery:** Retransmission of lost packets and acknowledgement messages.
- **Flow Control:** Techniques like TCP windowing to control the rate of data transmission.

### 5. Session

**Function:** The Session layer manages sessions between applications. It establishes, maintains, and terminates connections between local and remote applications.

**Details and Examples:**

- **Session Management:** Establishing a session for a video conference call.
- **Synchronization:** Checkpoints in data streams to ensure data integrity.
- **Protocols:** NetBIOS, RPC (Remote Procedure Call).

### 6. Presentation

**Function:** The Presentation layer translates data between the application layer and the network. It handles data encryption, compression, and translation.

**Details and Examples:**

- **Data Translation:** Converting data formats like EBCDIC to ASCII.
- **Encryption:** SSL/TLS protocols for secure data transmission.
- **Compression:** JPEG, MPEG for reducing data size.

### 7. Application

**Function:** This layer provides network services directly to end-user applications. It includes protocols such as HTTP, FTP, and SMTP.

**Details and Examples:**

- **Protocols:** HTTP for web browsing, FTP for file transfers, SMTP for email.
- **Services:** Web services, email services, file transfer services.
- **Applications:** Web browsers, email clients, file transfer applications.

### 8. User

**Function:** The User layer represents the end-users who interact with the network services. It encompasses user interfaces and user experience considerations.

**Details and Examples:**

- **User Interfaces:** Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for applications.
- **User Experience:** Design considerations for ease of use and accessibility.
- **Examples:** A user accessing a web application through a browser.

### 9. Company

**Function:** This layer represents organizational structures and policies. It includes corporate network management, security policies, and compliance requirements.

**Details and Examples:**

- **Network Management:** IT departments managing corporate networks.
- **Security Policies:** Implementing firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
- **Compliance:** Adhering to regulations like GDPR and HIPAA.

### 10. Country

**Function:** The Country layer addresses national-level networking considerations, including regulatory compliance, national security, and country-wide network infrastructure.

**Details and Examples:**

- **Regulatory Compliance:** National regulations for data privacy and security.
- **National Security:** Measures to protect national infrastructure from cyber threats.
- **Infrastructure:** National broadband initiatives, country-wide network infrastructure.

### 11. World

**Function:** The World layer encompasses global networking standards and international cooperation. It includes global internet governance, international regulatory bodies, and worldwide network infrastructure.

**Details and Examples:**

- **Global Standards:** ISO/IEC standards for networking.
- **International Cooperation:** Organizations like ICANN, ITU.
- **Worldwide Infrastructure:** Submarine communication cables, global satellite networks.

## 3. Conclusion

The extended OSI model provides a comprehensive framework that includes technical networking layers as well as organizational and global considerations. This model aims to address the complexities of modern networking environments and the interconnected nature of global communications.
